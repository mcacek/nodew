# nodew

Simple [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm "NVM") wrapper that installs node and provides binary wrappers.

## Usage
The anticipated usage would be to first pull these scripts into your project and leave them in a nodew directory. From there all assocaited node tasks will run through either the nodew script itself or through the convenience node and npm wrappers.
